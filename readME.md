📈 SEC Filing EBITDA Extractor & Excel Automation

A Python and VBA-based automation tool that extracts or estimates EBITDA from SEC filings and writes the results directly into Excel.

📦 Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

pip install requests xlwings msal

📊 EBITDA Extraction Logic
✅ When EBITDA Is Reported

Use the official XBRL tag:

EarningsBeforeInterestTaxesDepreciationAndAmortization

⚙️ When EBITDA Is Not Reported

Estimate EBITDA using the standard formula:

EBITDA = Net Income
       + Interest
       + Taxes
       + Depreciation
       + Amortization

🔁 Verification Formula (Alternative)
EBITDA = Net Sales
       – Operating Expenses (excluding Depreciation & Amortization)

🚫 Why We Don’t Use Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA includes non-standard, company-specific items (e.g., stock-based compensation, restructuring costs).

These adjustments are not part of the official US-GAAP XBRL taxonomy.

They are typically only available in press releases or investor presentations, not in machine-readable filings.

🧮 Calculation Details

Q4 Derivation

Q4 = Annual - Q1 - Q2 - Q3


Gross Margin
Rounded to the nearest integer.

Net Cash Flow from Operations
Uses the XBRL tag:

NetCashProvidedByUsedInOperatingActivities

⚙️ Configuration & Troubleshooting

If the program stops working:

✅ Re-save (overwrite) the Excel file in the same location.

✅ Make sure no other programs are accessing the file.

✅ Close all open Excel windows — multiple instances can interfere with VBA.

🧩 Root Cause & Solution

This issue typically occurs when Python cannot locate the Excel file due to a relative path problem.
Re-saving the file updates its reference and resolves the issue.

💡 Best Practice: Always use absolute file paths for reliability.

📌 Data Assumptions

We always compare companies using their most recent SEC filings, regardless of fiscal calendar.

Why This Approach Works

Keeps comparisons aligned across the most current timeframes

Ensures timely, relevant insights

Designed for both quarterly and annual reporting cycles

🧠 Metric Reference Guide
Metric	Description	Indicates
Net Sales	Total revenue earned	Top-line performance
Gross Profit	Sales minus COGS	Production efficiency
EBITDA	Core operating performance	Operational health
SG&A	Selling, general & administrative expenses	Overhead efficiency
Net Cash from Ops	Cash generated by core business	True financial strength
💼 Business Applications
1. Acquisition Targeting

Insight: Identify companies with falling revenue but strong EBITDA or cash flow.
Action: Flag as acquisition opportunities with potential for cost optimization.

2. Overhead Efficiency

Insight: Benchmark SG&A as a percentage of revenue.
Action: If higher than peers, reduce costs through restructuring or vendor renegotiation.

3. Margin & Pricing Strategy

Insight: Compare gross and EBITDA margins across competitors.
Action: Optimize pricing or cost structure; expand high-margin business lines.

4. Cash Flow Risk Monitoring

Insight: Spot firms with strong EBITDA but weak or negative cash flow.
Action: Track for instability — potential hiring, customer capture, or distressed acquisition opportunities.

🗒️ Notes

“Net Cash Flow from Operations” corresponds to “Net cash used in operating activities” on SEC filings.

Comparing the latest filings ensures a consistent, real-time view — even across different fiscal calendars.

The dashboard refreshes quarterly, maintaining alignment with the most recent financial data available.
